This repo is the home to some of my projects between 2023 to Present.
It has ideas from my senior design project like using cameras to measure distance and the rough app I made to output the distance measurements 
It also includes parts of my attempt to make an ad free youtube to mp4 converter. (Most of the code for that project is in Hemloc)
